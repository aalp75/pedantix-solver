## TO DO ##

- add some logs (as long as it doesn't slow the process)
- use async to test the final answer
- use a dictionnary to store the current word positions[index] = word

## DONE ##

- the second argument "game" is not parsable
- get the number of words to guess from the pedantix page
- use the post request to check if we have the answer instead of writing the result on the page
- stop the game when we found the answer
